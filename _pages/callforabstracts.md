We solicit single-page abstracts of either published work or research in progress. We plan to make a selection of papers that will be presented as a talk, or poster. We invite submissions on all topics related to data management, including but not limited to:

 - data storage, indexing, and management
 - database theory, data models, semantics and languages
 - database performance and scalability
 - data integration, data quality, data cleaning, ontologies
 - data mining, machine learning, information retrieval
 - data security, privacy and personalization
 - big data and data science

The main aim of the Bavarian Database Day is to foster interaction and collaboration among data management enthusiasts in Bavaria (and beyond). We plan to establish a **tradition of favouring presentations by junior researchers**. Proposals for presentations should be made before the deadline. Each submission should contain:

 - the title of the presentation
 - the name and affiliation of the prospective speaker
 - an abstract of the presentation
 - reference(s) to papers covered by the proposed presentation.

There are no printed proceedings. Accepted abstracts will be published on the website and will be presented at the workshop.
