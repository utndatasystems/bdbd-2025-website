We invite the submission of **single-page abstracts** describing either published work or ongoing research. A selection of submissions will be chosen for presentation as talks or posters.

We welcome contributions on all topics related to data management, including (but not limited to):

- Data storage, indexing, and management
- Database theory, models, semantics, and query languages
- Database performance and scalability
- Data integration, data quality, data cleaning, and ontologies
- Data mining, machine learning, and information retrieval
- Data security, privacy, and personalization
- Big data and data science

The Bavarian Database Day aims to foster interaction and collaboration among data management researchers and practitioners in Bavaria (and beyond). A central goal of the event is to establish a tradition of highlighting presentations by junior researchers.

**Proposals for presentations must be [submitted](https://forms.gle/QojGZcM8aoTkV2757) by September 3, 2025, 11:59 PM (Germany time)** and must include:

- The name and affiliation of the prospective speaker
- The title of the presentation
- An abstract of the presentation
- References to any papers covered by the proposed talk

There will be no printed proceedings. Accepted abstracts will be published on the workshop website and presented at the event. Notifications of acceptance will be sent on September 8, 2025.
