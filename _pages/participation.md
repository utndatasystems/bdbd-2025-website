### Transportation
Nuremberg is perfectly reachable by train.
From the central station, you can take the U1 towards "Langwasser Süd" (south) and get off after 5mins at "Bauernfeindstraße". From there, walk around 400m to the north-west.

There is also a Park+Ride parking area at U-Bahn station "Bauernfeindstraße".

### Wi-Fi
`eduroam` will be available at Cube One.

### Registration
TBD

### History & Local Attractions
Nuremberg has a rich cultural history. As one of the most important cities in the late Middle Ages where the imperial regalia (the imperial crown, the imperial cross, the holy lance, ...) of the Holy Roman Empire were kept, the city's most prominent landmark is the [Kaiserburg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YeA2ZbKxPtgBHYDr6), located near the city center. It's also possible to take tours along the old city walls and go underground through secret passages and tunnels.

### Accommodation
We recommend the [Cloud One](https://www.the-cloud-one.com/de/hotels/nuernberg/hotel-nuernberg/) hotel.
It is close to the central train station and therefore also the U1.

Please book your accomodation well in advance because there is a congress happening at the same time.
Because of that, we managed to secure a guaranteed number of available rooms for 139€ per night.
